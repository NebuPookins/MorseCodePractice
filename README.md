# Ideas for contributions:

* Add some sort of UI to adjust the speed/difficulty.
	* I'm thinking of making the "What is this?" section a tabbed pane and then you could put all the settings there.
* Bigger word list
	* Probably going to want to move the wordlist to its own file.
	* But then make sure the app still works offline.
	* Add settings to tailor wordlist (e.g. minimum/maximum length word).
* Add an option to use Sound?
* Add a UI so the user can actually enter in their guess and have the app tell them if they're right or wrong.
